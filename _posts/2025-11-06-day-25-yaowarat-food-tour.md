  - title: Market Breakfast
    text: |
      I headed to a close by market to grab some breakfast. It was essentially a huge food court with vendors all along the edges of an open area filled with tables and chairs.

  - title: Boat Noodle Lunch
    text: |
      For lunch, I walked to a boat noodle restaurant. In case you haven’t heard of them before (I hadn’t), they’re noodles in this dark, rich, complex, delicious broth with pork, beef and your choice of noodles. They're called boat noodles because they were originally sold off boats in the canals.

      caption: This was so tasty. I also really enjoyed that there was a bunch of green onion in there to give it a bit of oniony bite and sweetness.
  - title: Chinatown Food Tour
    text: |
      For “dinner”, I took a train to Yaowarat, Bangkok’s Chinatown. I met up with my guide Johnny and a few other folks looking to explore what Bangkok had to offer. We got to try several interesting dishes as we walked around the area and were left stuffed by the end of it.

      caption: The scallion dumplings plated up. These were really crispy on the outside and soft and oniony on the inside. They also came with a dark spicy sauce (which you can see in the background here) which added another dimension to the flavour.

      caption: The huge pot of pork leg stew outside the next shop

      caption: The pork leg stew plated up. You can see the accompaniments here too - raw garlic cloves, vinegar with chilli, and whole birds eye chilli’s. You essentially take a spoonful of the stew and balance it with a bit of everything to amp the spice and acidity.

      caption: The stall cooking up a bunch of pork satay
    - src: /assets/images/day25/ft-6.jpg
      caption: The satay was served with spicy peanut sauce (in the back) and a vinegary salad they called “achaar” (on the right). The satay was super tender, marinated nicely, and who doesn’t like peanuts.

      caption: This is thai style sukiyaki, which is a hotpot-style soup served with noodles. Ours came with winter melon, pork, bok choy and glass noodles. Sauce on the side to allow people to control their spice levels, but you basically just add as much of the sweet, spicy sauce to the soup as you want. Really tasty and also new to me!

      caption: The next restaurant serves shrimp dumpings, which are being steamed in that huge pot on the right
    - src: /assets/images/day25/ft-9.jpg
      caption: Shrimp dumplings with black vinegar. These dumplings were super tasty. Super thin wrapper, tender shrimp, a touch of dark vinegar to offer some acidity and fried garlic to top it all off!

      caption: Green curry with rice noodles and chinese sausage. I’d never had thai style curry with noodles before, and the chinese sausage bit was also new to me! Super rich, creamy, spicy curry but the noodles were a bit of a miss for me as they were just difficult to eat with a spoon.

      caption: Soy sauce ice cream. I love when sweet things have a bit of saltiness to them so I really enjoyed this. Soft creamy ice cream topped with a bit of sweetened dark soy sauce.

      caption: Raw mango with a sweet chilli paste made with tomato and dried shrimp. I really enjoyed this, the contrast of the sour mango with the sweet salty fishy chilli paste was so satisfying.

      caption: Tom Yum in the classic clear style (the creamy version that is more common in the US is a more recent invention). This was really tasty - spicy and sour, both flavours I love.

      caption: Stir fried morning glory, fairly similar to the one I made in Vietnam during the cooking class with the addition of a bit of fish sauce and chilli
    - src: /assets/images/day25/ft-17.jpg
      caption: Spicy stir fried clams. These were so good, extremely spicy but very tasty.
    - src: /assets/images/day25/ft-18.jpg
      caption: Grilled river prawns. You can see the little bowl of seafood sauce in the back - spicy, herby, slightly sour and a great accompaniment to the freshly grilled prawns!

Today I ate food, and then I ate some more food.
