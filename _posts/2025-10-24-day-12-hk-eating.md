      In the afternoon, I headed to the temple street night market with the intention of having some street food, but noticed this little hole in the wall Nepali restaurant and decided I wanted momos instead

      For a light-ish dinner, I headed to this michelin-recommended (not starred) stall that serves Sheng Jian Bao (Shanghai pan-fried buns). They had several interesting flavours!
