    text: |
      I started off the day with another convenience store egg sandwich. I love these things. I then headed over the Tokyo shinkansen station and got on the train to Osaka. These things are great. It took me all the way to Osaka in 2.5 hours! I got to see some beautiful views of quaint Japanese towns, lakes and green hills. It also gave me some time to write the blog for yesterday’s visit to FujiQ and read.

  - title: "Kobe Beef!"
    text: |
      One of the other people on the Izakaya tour from a couple days ago had talked about this place in Osaka that they said was their favourite meal in Japan, a Kobe beef teppanyaki spot in Osaka. So of course, immediately after arriving I beelined straight to that restaurant. Osaka is very close to Kobe and as a result has a lot of really good beef. This stuff was so tender and fatty. It was also fun to watch the chef cooking everything on the griddle in front of me.

      caption: "The full meal. At the top: mushrooms, sweet potato, zucchini and peppers. In the middle: that good A5 kobe. At the bottom: pickled garlic, wasabi and miso. On the left (slightly out of frame) is a dipping tray with salt in one compartment and a mixture of sesame and soy sauce in the other. I added wasabi to the meat and sometimes garlic too, and then dipped it in either salt or soy. Delicious stuff. The miso was only for the vegetables as the flavour was too strong for the delicate meat."

      After eating, I wondered around Dotonbori market for a while. Since I had just eaten, I didn’t really take advantage of any of the interesting looking food stalls, but I enjoyed my walk and it was a good way to speed up the digestion so I could try some more meat!

      After my delicious meal earlier I wanted to try more meat! I found this place with a long line and decided to stand in it with everyone. Clearer the people of Osaka know what they’re about, because the beef tongue (gyutan means beef tongue) and grilled beef were delicious, and all the sides were incredible too!

      caption: "I ordered a lemonade and was a bit surprised to be handed a lemon and a squeezer. I guess it allows people to customize how lemony they want it? I of course fully squeezed the lemon to get the maximum lemon taste"

      caption: "My food! In the center, we have beef tongue on the left and rare wagyu sirloin on the right. Directly above that we have a raw egg yolk for dipping the sirloin. Starting in the top-right and going clockwise: salad, slow cooked beef tongue soup, rice with salmon roe and an egg yolk, miso paste, japanese curry"

      After that, I needed another walk so I made my way to Osaka Castle. It was really beautiful, with a carefully tended garden filled with interestingly shaped trees, and several buildings with classic Japanese architecture.

  - title: "Okonomiyaki"

      Of course, couldn’t leave without having some Okonomiyaki. Despite probably having had enough to eat for the day, I needed to get some while I was here. Unfortunately the place Chacha and Chachi had recommended to me was closed on Sundays but I was able to find another one that looked good, and indeed it was delicious.

      caption: "The finished product. They leave the griddle on and you have to cut slices off and serve them for yourself, so the bottom gets crispier as you eat! Towards the end it started getting a bit too charred so the last couple slices came off together but it was a really cool experience of the texture changing throughout the meal."

      Having achieved all my goals for the day, I made my way back to the shinkansen station 🚅 and back to Tokyo.
