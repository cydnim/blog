- title: Round 2 bitches
  text: "We had to get to the hospital at 5:30 am. This was my first time getting
    an epidural which i was very anxious about but my anesthesiologist was very nice
    and gave me lots of drugs to calm me down and I can\u2019t remember if it hurt.
    TBH dont remember much of that interaction.\n"

- title: IV's and Hematoma's
  text: "Apparently I\u2019m the hardest donkey to pin a tail on all since my IVs
    hurt or are fighting back. Got a pretty good hematoma from my surgical arterial
    and some old stick bruises due to my rolling viens."

- title: Finally out of Surgery
  text: "After a 5 hour surgery and a few hours in recovery/ waiting for a room I
    was finally moved to my room where Sahir was waiting.\n\nThe rest of the day was
    quite easy with the epidural keeping my pain to a minimum. My entire left leg
    was completely numb because of the epidural and he made it so somehow my left
    leg stayed numb much longer than my right. \n\nTook advantage of the numbness
    to cough up the intubation gunk. Yum\u2026"
