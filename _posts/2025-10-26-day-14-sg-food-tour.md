      Paul, Steven and I reconvened at the hotel after our various morning activities to head to the Singapore National Museum. We joined a free tour and learned about Singapore's history from pre-colonial times, to British colonization, to the Japanese occupation during WW2, post-war independence and the buildup of industry in the country. We also went to another exhibit called Once Upon a Tide which tracked Singapore's transformation from a small port city to what it is today with a focus on how the sea and river shaped it.

      After heading back to our hotel for a quick break, we headed back out to Maxwell Hawker Centre for a food tour. We met a punjabi couple on the tour and got to try a _lot_ of different food, and tasted items from Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam while learning a little about the history of the neighbourhoods. We left completely stuffed.
