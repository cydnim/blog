summary: Not much happening lately, I have been stable and just trying to study!
events:
- title: labral 2 week clearance for increased weight baring
  text: Got my stitches removed and was approved for increase to weight baring as
    tolerated until next surgery! Team said everything looks good!
- title: The diagnosis we've all been waiting for...
  text: "My tilt table results are finally in and confirm I do in fact have POTS.
    Very affirming, given years of problems. Now I can stop saying \u201Csuspected
    POTS\u201D and having to explain myself every time I speak to a provider. Small
    wins. This will hopefully help them watch out for anything that could flare me
    and help support me if I run into any problems during recovery!"
