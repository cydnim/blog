  - title: Food tour!
    text: |
      I grabbed a cab relatively early to head to the Phuket old town for a food tour for "brunch"! In case you haven't realized yet I wanna do at least one food tour everywhere I go :D

      caption: Kuay Jab! These were rolled rice noodles in a slightly sweet dark broth, with various cuts of pork including pork belly and pork heart. Super rich and tasty, slightly sweet. The broth was similar to the boat noodles from a few days ago.

      caption: Next stop was a Burmese spot. We had samosas and tandoori rotis served with goat curry, daal, chickpea stew and some fermented roselle leaves. We also had a tea salad (which I did not grab a photo of).

      caption: Popiah again, it was good with some pork in it this time compared to the vegetarian one I had in the Singapore food tour.

      caption: Hokkien noodles with seafood. These were pretty tasty, though the fact they were served with a spoon was a bit odd. Much easier to eat noodles with chopsticks imo.

      caption: Lor bak sausage wrapped in beancurd skin. This was so tasty, very crispy and nicely spiced with a tasty peanut sauce on the side.

      caption: My guide just called this "rice salad". The rice is cooked with butterfly pea flowers to get the blue colour and came with some minced pork, peanut and various veggies. We mixed up everything you see on the rice plate and wrapped it in lettuce. Was very refreshing and tasty!

      caption: Murtabak with vinegar and chillies! The vinegar really helped cut through the fattiness of the murtabak.

      caption: Teh tarik made with Thai tea. It was super foamy!

      caption: Fried banana pancakes made with charcoal and pandan (can you figure out which is which?). A very tasty dessert with super sweet banana.

      caption: Lemon lychee aiyu. This was a super refreshing dessert after a lot of walking around in the heat. Shaved ice with a strong lemon flavour topped with aiyu jelly and a few lychees.

  - title: Reading on the beach
    text: |
      After a long taxi ride back to my side of the island, I headed over to the beach. I was worried I'd get rained out but thankfully the rain stopped fairly quickly. It was coming down hard though! I rented a beach chair and umbrella and laid down and read for a couple hours. Very nice and relaxing.

      caption: Post rain. It was still a bit cloudy but it warmed up real quick...

  - title: Khao Kluk Kapi Dinner
    text: |
      When I got hungry, I headed over to a restaurant my food tour guide had recommended to try khao kluk kapi, which is shrimp paste fried rice surrounded by various toppings. I got it with chicken. It was super tasty, the fried rice was super savoury and mixing in the toppings bit by bit gave it a lot of variety in taste and texture. Would recommend.

Today I ate food and then went to the beach and then ate more food.
