  - title: Monas Repeat
    text: |
      My tour guide picked me up at the hotel at 9, and I made it to Monas successfully this time! While I didn’t go up the tower, I was still glad to get a closer look today.

  - title: Old Harbour
    text: |
      Next up was the old harbour. It’s still in use today, but only for domestic shipping. It was super flooded when we got there so I wasn’t able to walk along the harbour, but we drove up to the edge and I was able to go up the stairs and get a closer look at some of the boats.

  - title: Old Town
    text: |
      Next was the Jakarta old town, from when it was named Batavia. We visited a puppet workshop, checked out the old town square and stopped at a cafe that specializes in jamu, a herbal drink made with haldi and ginger (where I also ate some tasty lunch).

      caption: The old town square, surrounded by the colonial governors office and home, and the colonial government buildings. The post office (on the left with the Indonesian flag) is the only one that retains its purpose today! The others have all been turned into museums.

      caption: While the traditional method is brewing it like a tea, this place presses the jamu like an espresso!

      caption: My lunch of beef ribs. These were slightly crispy, super tendy, a bit sweet and very savoury with a touch of spice. Very tasty.
  - title: Jakarta Cathedral
    text: |
      This cathedral was built during the Dutch colonial era. It is huge, and the inside walls are painted with depictions of Jesus’ life. The most interesting part to me though were the holy water dispensers along the walls of the cathedral, not something I’d ever seen before (not like I visit a lot of churches but I’ve been to a few and never seen this before).

  - title: Masjid Istiqlal
    text: |
      We ended the tour right across the street from the cathedral at Southeast Asia’s largest masjid. It was built after Indonesia’s independence, and the name Istiqlal means independence in Arabic. The construction also contains references to the date of independence, such as the 45 meter dome over the main prayer chamber which represents 1945, the year Indonesia gained independence. The spot directly opposite the cathedral was chosen partially to symbolise religious harmony, and also because it is near the Merdeka Palace.

  - title: Soto Snack
    text: |
      For a mid-afternoon snack, I walked from my hotel to a restaurant serving soto betawi. The betawi are the original people from this region of Indonesia, so it’s a truly local Jakarta dish. It’s a beef soup with lots of herbs and spices made creamy with coconut milk. Really enjoyed it! It had a strong galangal and lemongrass flavour, making it somewhat similar to Thai tom kha, but slightly less rich and more refreshing.

  - title: Grocery Shopping?
    text: |
      Mama and Papa lived in Indonesia for a while and Kaamya had several Indonesian friends in boarding school, so I had been given a shopping list of some ingredients that were difficult to find in the US and they wanted me to bring back for them (thankfully they were kind enough to keep it short). I wandered around a grocery store for a bit, eventually finding everything they wanted.
  - title: Murtabak Dinner (and Dessert!)
    text: |
      Indonesia has two varieties of murtabak - a savoury one with meat and eggs, and a fluffy sweet one which can come with a number of toppings, but often including butter, chocolate sprinkles and cheese (yes, cheese). I got both, getting a spicy beef and duck egg murtabak and a sweet chocolate, cheese and banana one. I was not able to finish either. I got 3/4 through the savoury one but only had two pieces of the sweet one… Wish I had been able to just buy a single piece 😅 They were both very tasty though - the egg one was crispy, spicy and meaty while the sweet one was soft, fluffy and decadent.
