  - title: Grilled Tuna "Breakfast"
    text: |
      After getting ready and checking out of my hotel, I left my bags there since my flight is super late tonight. I made my way to a restaurant that serves various types of tuna. While their specialty is a grilled tuna jaw that looked really good, it seemed a bit too large for one person so I instead ordered grilled tuna belly with rice. I received five pieces of grilled tuna and a really tasty spicy sambal that I devoured with the rice.

  - title: National Library

      My tour guide yesterday had recommended the national library as a free alternative to going up Monas since it has a balcony at a similar height. This turned out to be a great recommendation and I got a good view of the city despite the weather being a bit cloudy. I relaxed here for a bit before heading back out.

  - title: Nasi Goreng Lunch
    text: |
      An iconic Indonesian dish (and probably the only one you see semi-regularly in the US apart from indomie) is nasi goreng, Indonesian fried rice. I was running out of time to rectify the fact that I hadn’t had any yet so I headed to a street stall serving some (which was surprisingly hard to find, it seems like most of these stalls only operate later at night and not in the middle of the day).

      After lunch I headed to a coffee shop to relax till it was close to when I needed to leave. I read for a bit and also wrote some more of these posts (which is why you’re getting several of them at once - I really needed to catch up).

  - title: Fancy Dinner
    text: |
      As it got closer to when I needed to go pick up my bags and call a cab, I headed over to Plataran Menteng, by far the most fancy restaurant I went to in Jakarta. I got iga rawot, braised beef ribs in a slightly sweet, very savoury sauce. The ribs were super tender and tasty. To go with the ribs, I got a side of some more nasi goreng (but with shrimp this time), because why not!

      caption: The beef ribs with salted duck eggs. After I discovered just how salty the duck eggs were, I cut them into tiny pieces and scattered them across the ribs which gave a really nice contrast to the rich, sweet braised ribs.
  - title: Airport Time
    text: |
      I made sure to leave with plenty of time to spare since Jakarta traffic can be very difficult to predict. I made it to the airport with some time to spare and waited in the lounge until my gate was open before boarding my redeye flight to Manila (leaving at 23:25 and getting in at 5:15 😭). It was one of 2 options available to me and the other one was also pretty bad, I would’ve picked something else if I could…

Today I explored Jakarta a bit more and left for (but did not reach) Manila
