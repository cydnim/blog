      I was picked up at my hotel early at 7:10 to make the 3 hour journey to Bandung.
  - title: Fruit Stand

      Our first stop was at a fruit stand where we got to have several different fruits. The snake skin fruit was completely new to me and tasted a bit like a pear but in the form factor of a lychee? That doesn’t really make sense but the point is that it was good, and so were the other fruits we tried.

      Next stop was a rice field where we learned a bit about rice farming here in Indonesia.

  - title: Tea Plantation
    text: |
      Next up was a tea plantation in the mountains. I found this surprisingly pretty with how the plants were aligned with the contours of the hills and had walking paths at regular intervals.

  - title: Volcano
    text: |
      Next up we visited a volcano! Not the type of volcano you’re probably expecting - no magma or lava here, this one mostly just produces sulphur. Even when it “erupts”, it just means you need to stay out of range of the crater to avoid the gas, but no danger of the nearby forests burning down. When we got out of the van there was a strong rotten egg smell but we gradually got used to it as we walked around.

      caption: While in the area, we tried a local drink of bandrek, which was a ginger, cinnamon and pepper drink sweetened with palm sugar that tasted great.
  - title: Lunch Break
    text: |
      Lunch was fairly mediocre, perhaps because the tour guide was trying to adapt to the palates of the Europeans on the tour (some of whom could not eat any spicy food…). Fairly bland fried food, the only thing of note was the kangkung stir fry.

  - title: Hot Springs
    text: |
      We then headed over to some hot springs powered by the nearby volcano. It was raining a bit but it was still nice to soak my feet in the hot water for a bit.

  - title: Honey Pineapple
    text: |
      Our last stop was another fruit stand, this one focused solely on honey pineapple, a local variety that is very sweet. After trying some pineapple we started the long journey back into Jakarta.

  - title: Dinner Delivery
    text: |
      I was too tired to go out for dinner so I ordered in instead. I asked my tour guide her favourite nasi padang spot and ordered from there. No photo bc it was messy but I got a sambal egg, brain curry and some greens (I am not honestly sure what they were, maybe papaya leaves?). It was all very tasty.

Today I got out of the city and explored the area around Bandung a bit.
