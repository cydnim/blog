- title: PT attempt TWO
  text: 'By the afternoon I could move my leg! PT helped me get up, had me walk to
    a restroom then sit in a chair. They said that was really good for my first day!
    Being on crutches for the last three weeks has probably helped with that.


    Then I got left in the chair too long and cried. But we made it through. Had my
    overnight hairdo still lol.'

- title: Too much Dilaudid
  text: "My pain management was not quite enough and I told my nurse and she gave
    me too much Dilaudid(not her fault I\u2019m just a light weight) thought my throat
    was closing but really it just hit me so fast my body panicked. I was stuppered
    for a while and couldn\u2019t eat my sour candy.\n\nThen slept through the night
    with just NSAIDs and tylenol!\n\n# 0 days since incident"
