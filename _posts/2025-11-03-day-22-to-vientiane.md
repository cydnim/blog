  - title: "Egg Coffee"
    text: |
      We headed out to try egg coffee, which is basically a shot of espresso with a thick, airy, almost meringue-like foam made by whipping an egg yolk with condensed milk for ~10 minutes. The "meringue" doesn't mix with the coffee well, so basically you keep sipping it and mixing and it gets a slightly stronger coffee flavour as you keep mixing it.

      After getting coffee I split up with Steven and Paul to check out from the hotel, head to the market for a bit and get some lunch.

      After getting lunch, I met back up with Steven and Paul at the Independence Palace. This palace was where the president of South Vietnam had lived before reunification, and was the home of the governor of Vietnam during the colonial era.

  - title: Worst leg room ever
    text: |
      After exploring the palace a bit, I said bye to Steven and Paul and headed to the airport for my flight to Vientiane. Do not fly VietJet if you can avoid it! This was probably the worst leg room I’ve ever had on a flight. Thankfully no one was sitting next to me so I was able to spread out a bit but still not fun…

      After arriving, I headed straight to my hotel and briefly enjoyed my view of the city before heading out for dinner.

  - title: Night Food Market
    text: |
      I headed to the Vientiane Night Food Market, which was essentially a block of the street that was filled with stalls and people selling various types of food. I grabbed food from a few different stalls.

      caption: The mushrooms sliced up with “seafood” sauce, which is essentially chilli, herbs, fish sauce and vinegar I think. Was really tasty.
