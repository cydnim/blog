  - title: "Early Drive"
    text: |
      We woke up bright and early to make the ~2 hour drive to Cai Be, the town on the Mekong that we'd be visiting. Got into a van with our tour guide Stag and the rest of the group, made a stop en route to get Banh Mi and zoomed along the highways.

      First stop was a wet market right on the river selling pretty much everything including knives and toys, but mostly focusing on fresh veggies and seafood.

      Next we hopped on our boat to ride over to a house boat where a lady sells coconuts, and were invited to take a look at the house and drink some fresh coconut water

      After another short ride, we switched to some smaller boats in order to take a ride through some canals to a river island.

      We stopped briefly at a local home where they gave us some guava and weaved some bracelets out of rivergrass for us

      We walked over to a little restaurant on the island where we had a snack of some fresh fruit and watched a singing performance in Vietnamese.

  - title: "Local Crafts"
    text: |
      The Mekong area is responsible for almost all of Vietnam's rice production, so we took a look at a few local shops where they made rice wine, popped rice and rice-based coconut sweets.

      We then took another ride down the river to the rice factories, but it started raining so hard partway through the ride that we didn't get a very good view unfortunately so all I have is a photo of the rain.

  - title: "Lunch"
    text: |
      After making our way out of the rain, we headed to a homestay and had some delicious home-cooked food that was very reminisicent of the food we had made yesterday during our cooking class. We also got the opportunity to roll some spring rolls of our own!

  - title: "Scootering about"
    text: |
      After lunch, we hopped on the backs of some scooters to explore the town a bit more. We stopped at a durian magnates house for a break and to stretch our legs before hopping back on the scooters to head back to our van, ready to head back to HCMC.

  - title: "Grilled seafood dinner"
    text: |
      For dinner, we headed to Vinh Kanh Food Street, which is a street with a bunch of seafood restaurants everywhere. We picked one that looked interesting, sat down and had some snails in black pepper sauce and garlic fried rice.
