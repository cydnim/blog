  - title: Bakso Brunch
    text: |
      For a late breakfast, I went to a bakso (meatball) stall down the road from my hotel. I got bakso soup with tendon and bihun (rice vermicelli). The soup came with plenty of spring onions and fried shallots, and was nicely spiced once I added a spoonful of the sambal on the table.

      After eating, I headed to a nearby coffee shop and got a lemon coffee. It was definitely interesting, I love everything lemon so I enjoyed it but I could see this one being a bit divisive.

  - title: Monas Mishap
    text: |
      After spending an embarrassingly long time figuring out the train system, getting off at the wrong stop and eventually realising I would’ve been better off just walking, I made it to the National Monument (aka Monas - Monument Nasional) only to discover that it was closed on Mondays 😭 Oh well - I’ll be coming back here in a couple days on a tour anyway.
  - title: Street Food Dinner
    text: |
      For dinner, I headed to an area in Blok M that had a nightly street food market. I had read that it could get pretty packed but thankfully when I went (~19:30) it was fairly easy to find somewhere to sit after grabbing food. I got food from a couple different stalls, including nasi bakar, satay and a local tea similar to egg coffee. Descriptions in the photos, but I apparently forgot to take a photo of nasi bakar so I’ll describe it here. Nasi bakar means grilled rice, and in my case the rice was wrapped with some sambal tuna in a banana leaf before being grilled over charcoal. It was really tasty - the rice was slightly smoky and had been flavoured a bit by the sambal tuna and the aroma of the banana leaf.

      caption: Padang style satay with a spicy sauce and rice cakes. I was expecting the sauce to be the usual peanut sauce for that I’m familiar with but was pleasantly surprised by the amount of spice here.

      caption: The egg tea - very similar to Vietnamese egg coffee but with a ginger tea instead of coffee below the egg foam and a slightly thinner layer of egg. They gave me some extra ginger on the side so I could adjust its strength to my liking.

Today I got shut out of exploration but ate some nice food :)
