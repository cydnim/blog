  - title: "Banh Mi Breakfast"
    text: |
      I walked over to a banh mi place for breakfast, they only served one type of banh mi - four types of ham with pate and pork floss. You pick up the banh mi at a window and head next door where they have some seating to eat. It came with fresh herbs, pickled daikon/carrot and a few pieces of cucumber in individually packaged bags for you to add as you see fit.

      caption: "I've made statements like this a few times on this blog at this point, but I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this is the best banh mi I've ever eaten. The bread was perfect - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside; the pate was smooth, creamy and slathered generously; the addition of pork floss was something I've never seen in the banh mi I've eaten in the US and it was definitely appreciated; the various types of ham were meaty and flavourful. Nothing bad to say about it. It was pretty large too!"

      After the heavy breakfast, we decided we should brave the heat and walk around a bit to help digest. I did somewhat regret it as I immediately became extremely sweaty due to the humidity, but we saw some cool stuff!

  - title: "Checking out and back in"
    text: |
      Since we had arrived a day early and our main hotel was completely full, we had needed to book a different hotel for the previous night. We checked out, and walked over to our new hotel - the Hotel Continental Saigon which was built in the French colonial era and is the oldest hotel in Vietnam! It's probably the most fancy spot I have booked for this entire trip. Very cool architecture and the rooms are huge - bigger than my first apartment in Seattle.

  - title: "War Remnants Museum"

      After checking into our new hotel, we headed out to this museum which highlights the Vietnam War. The outside showcased some of the weaponry left behind after the US retreated. The inside contained an interesting temporary exhibit and several very sobering exhibits detailing the impact the war had on the people of Vietnam. The temporary exhibit was about the impact the war had on food, and detailed several things such as how some crops like peanuts became very common due to how easy and quick they were to grow and harvest; how people had to change their cooking habits to support the soldiers; how soldiers learned how to identify wild leaves and fruit that were safe to eat in order to minimize what they carried; and more.

  - title: "Nha Tu Lunch"

      We headed over to Nha Tu, which was in a small fairly residential-looking alleyway for lunch. We got a few different items that were all pretty tasty.

      caption: "Bo Nuong La Lot, which is ground beef wrapped in la lot (a type of plant) leaves and grilled. This is one of my favourite dishes to get with my banh mi in Seattle so I was excited to try it here. It was definitely tasty, but I think I actually like the Seattle version better (mostly comes down to the sauce they serve it with tbh, the one I get at home comes with an fishy, sour chilli sauce that I love dipping the rolls in)."

      caption: "This looks simple - it's just steamed veggies - but the key is that sauce on the side which is a thick, sweet, caramelized fish sauce with chili and bits of pork belly fried to the point of being completely crispy."

  - title: Burning Monk Memorial
    text: |
      In 1963, a monk named Thich Quang Duc burned himself to death in a Saigon intersection to protest the South Vietnamese Government's discrimination against Buddhists (you've seen the photo). We stopped at his memorial monument on our way home.

  - title: Halloween
    text: |
      After resting in the hotel for a bit, we decided that we should go do something fun for Halloween. We ended up barhopping around district 2, which is where all the expats live. We started off in a rooftop bar with a couple cocktails and then mostly drank beer at various bars around the district. We also managed to make some friends with a group of expats from England, France, Australia and even one guy from Seattle!

Today I went to a museum, ate food, and drank more than I have in quite a while.
