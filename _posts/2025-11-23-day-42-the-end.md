      After 6 weeks, it was finally time to head back home. I enjoyed this trip so much. People were telling me that I'd be super ready to come back after so much travel, but honestly I'm a bit bummed it's ending (what feels like) so soon. That said, I _am_ very much looking forward to seeing everyone in Dallas for Thanksgiving, and more importantly Zuko! Until next time, SEA!
