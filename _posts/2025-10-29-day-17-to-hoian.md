      I headed back to the hotel, finished packing and we headed to the airport for our flight to Da Nang (which is the closest airport to Hoi An). We were a little bit worried since there was heavy flooding due to rain in central Vietnam, including the area we were visiting. Thankfully no issues with the flight.

      We got out of the airport and the rain was certainly aggressive... We got into our taxi and were regularly driving through huge pools of water, and it was clear how bloated the rivers were when driving over them (thankfully they were still far off from the bridges). We got to the airbnb and were greeted by our host, but the rain was certainly putting a damper on my hopes of sitting on the beach and reading my book.

      We walked a couple minutes away to a little family restaurant that was basically the front porch of someone's home. We got banh canh, which is a type of noodle soup. Unfortunately, I forgot to get a photo but the table was covered with small bowls of toppings/sauces that you could add to customize them however you wish, including crispy chilis, lemon, pickled onions, nuoc cham, sambal and more!

      We braved the rain again to get dinner. It was also good.

      caption: "Cao Lau with duck. This is a regional dish from Hoi An, so we figured we should get it while we were here. It was tasty and the duck was soft and tender, but I wasn't too crazy about the noodle texture/shape personally."

      caption: "Grilled scallops. These were so good. They were topped with chopped chives in a green, herby oil and came to us piping hot (I couldn't pick up the shell right when they were brought out actually). Favourite dish of the night."

      caption: "Possibly the best spring roll I've ever had? The wrapping was thin, lacy and shatteringly crisp with a flavorful, juicy filling and nuoc cham for dipping."

      caption: "Super tender grilled duck with a strong smoky flavour and more nuoc cham for dipping."

  - title: Tough Decisions
    text: |
      Our area around the beach was extremely wet, and the Hoi An ancient town (which is a unesco cultural heritage due to it being a very well-preserved trading port) was completely flooded, meaning we wouldn't be able to visit it at all. So the two things we were looking forward to (beach relaxation and old town exploration) were impossible. As a result, we ended up deciding to change our tickets onward to Ho Chi Minh City - instead of leaving on the 31st at 5pm, we cut our stay short to leave tomorrow (on the 30th) at 2pm in order to have more time there.

Today I flew to Vietnam and got wet.
