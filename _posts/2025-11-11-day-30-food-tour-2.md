      Yep, a second food tour in Phuket! This was a dinner food tour instead, and covered (mostly) different restaurants in a different part of the city though.

      caption: Curry chicken puff. Flaky pastry with a slightly sweet and slightly spicy chicken filling. The filling was really tasty, but the pastry was a bit thick for my liking.

      caption: Dry noodles and pork soup. Tasty stir fried noodles with a light soup which had a clean, porky flavour.

      caption: Chor Muang or “Royal Flower Dumplings”. This was really interesting. In addition to being very pretty, this had a light, delicate chicken flavour and a glutinous, jelly-like texture. Really enjoyed it with a bit of the birds eye chilli on the left!

      caption: Several Thai cookies. The one on the left is a coconut meringue, the one in the middle is a slightly salty shortbread-style biscuit and I don’t remember exactly what the one on the right was but the middle was slightly like marzipan without the almond flavour. My favourite was the middle one.

      caption: Braised ginger chicken. This had a light flavour, slightly alcoholic-tasting from the cooking wine with a good amount of ginger.

      caption: Stir fried morning glory. This is definitely a staple around here, I’ve seen it a bunch. Same as the last few times I tried it, tasty!

      caption: Grilled fish with curry paste. Really enjoyed this fish, it was super tender and the curry paste provided the strong flavours that I crave. Deboning fish is always such a pain though…

      caption: Tom kha with chicken. This was definitely more spicy and less sweet than the tom kha I’m used to from the US, I really enjoyed it.

      caption: Kuay Jab again. I learned that kuay jab just refers to the style of the rolled rice noodles - the broth here was super different from yesterday and had a cleaner pork taste with a strong peppery flavour.

      caption: Dessert was sticky rice with four toppings. Two were made with coconut shreds that had been cooked with sugar and tasted almost similar to a halwa, one was a custard and the fourth was just slices of ripe jackfruit. I really liked the orange one which I think was coconut with pandan.
