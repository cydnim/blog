      I woke up early to make it to the airport in time for my flight since my hotel was about an hour away from the airport. Made it in time but my flight was delayed as usual :)

      Wandered around the Jalan Petaling market for a bit before stopping to get some nasi lemak. It was decent, the squid was really tasty but the rice was a bit dry. This wasn't a "real" nasi lemak spot in the sense that it was a street restaurant that happened to have nasi lemak on the menu. I'll definitely be trying out an actual nasi lemak spot (or several) soon (where all they serve is nasi lemak). I stopped back in at the market to get a granny pancake with peanuts like the ones I had found in Singapore.

  - title: Chicken Rice Dinner

      After walking around a little bit and resting in my hotel for a while, I headed back out for dinner. I decided to go to a chicken rice spot, since the chicken rice here is different to the Singaporean one. Here, the standard seems to be roasted chicken, while in Singapore boiled is the standard. I like both! The chicken did not disappoint - it was still very tender despite the different cooking method and very flavourful. And I still got my ginger, chilli and sweet soy sauces on the side.

      I headed up to the roof of my hotel to check out the view before turning in for the night
