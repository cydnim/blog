      After everyone was ready, we headed to Hong Lim Centre for some food. I mostly refrained from eating (I had a bite from Steven and Paul) since we were actually just "pregaming" lunch, but Paul got some confit duck and Steven got some char siew wonton noodles.

      For the "real" lunch, we walked over to Shrimp Prawn Seafood which is right on the river. This was my favourite meal last time I was in Singapore and remains a strong contender this visit too! Grilled shellfish over vermicelli served in a hot steel pan, with a super spicy chili sauce on the side. Good stuff. We also got some veggies and grilled pork skewers (moo ping).

    text: |
      After lunch we walked over to the Gardens by the Bay. They have two huge conservatories there that are actually air conditioned in order to allow plants that need a cooler environment to survive in Singapore's heat. They use some specially treated glass to minimize heat passage while maximizing light for the plants in addition to some other strategies to make these large air conditioned domes more sustainable. We also went up to the top of one of the "supertree"s, which are large vertical gardens made to look like trees.

      After exploring the gardens, we headed over to the oceanarium on Sentosa Island. There were some really beautiful exhibits full of cool marine creatures including jellyfish, sharks, rays, and various types of fish small and large. They even had some pressurized tanks for deeper sea fish!

    text: |
      After heading back from the oceanarium, we were hungry and headed over to Maxwell Centre to grab some dinner. Surprisingly, a lot of stuff was already closed at 19:15 so our options were limited. I did get some tasty stuff though - nasi lemak with chicken rendang!

      Paul did not come back from the Oceanarium with Steven and me, instead he headed back to the gardens to see the light show they do with the supertrees. He has sent me some of the photos to share with you :)
