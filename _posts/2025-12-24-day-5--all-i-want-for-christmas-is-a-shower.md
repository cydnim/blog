- title: 'Called resident line at 2:30 am '
  text: Took cyclobenzaprine muscle relaxer at bed time too close to my anti-histamine
    not knowing they shared some effects and ended up with full body tingling and
    eventually panic for hours instead of a deep sleep. All was assured by resident
    on call and finally went to sleep at 4am when the tingling started to subside
    enough to ignore it. Love when the internet says youre dying. Really just adds
    to the fire. All good now!
- title: Big bandage off!
  text: Sahir and I played a game of guess where the scars are. We were pleasantly
    surprised there was only two incisions.
