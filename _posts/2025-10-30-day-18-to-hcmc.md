      Started the day with a walk over to a close by coffee shop. This is probably the prettiest coffee shop I've ever seen. The coffee was really good too. We then walked to the edge of the beach to see the effect the rain was having on it, and it was pretty much completely flooded.

      This airbnb actually serves breakfast! Last night the host took our breakfast orders, and this morning a chef came in to prepare it for us. I got Mi Quang, which is a noodle dish from Central Vietnam (which is where Hoi An is) and has a turmeric-infused broth.

      Our travel to HCMC had a couple delays - first our driver was 15 min late due to the flooding, and then the plane was just stuck in place for over an hour after everyone had boarded. We ended up leaving Da Nang after the point where we were meant to reach HCMC! After arriving in HCMC, we took a cab to our hotel for the night, checked in and then headed out to eat.

      We walked 20ish min from our hotel to Bep Me In, a family-style Vietnamese restaurant that also offered some street food dishes. A great first meal in HCMC.

      caption: "This is a very popular street food called Banh Xeo. We got it with shrimp and pork. It's a crispy vietnamese crepe made of a rice flour batter (it isn't an omelette! the yellow is from turmeric) folded in half around a filling of stir fried beansprouts and your choice of protein. We asked how to eat it and were told to take a piece of rice paper, place a piece of lettuce in, followed by a slice of banh xeo and some of the other greens, and eat it kind of like a taco. Super tasty and the highlight of this restaurant for me."

      caption: "Fried tofu with sesame seeds. This had a light spiciness which almost felt similar to a sichuan pepper. I'm not sure where that was coming from but these were really tasty."

      caption: "Gotta get your veggies in, and it was interesting to eat these vietnamese pumpkins with the flowers still attached"
    - src: /assets/images/day18/bmi-pork-belly.jpg
      caption: "Braised pork belly and egg. This had a super deep, rich flavour due to the long braise. The pork was super tender and we weren't sure if you were meant to eat the braising liquid but we did, and it was delicious."

      caption: "Deep fried pork served in bamboo. This one threw me off initially due to the sweetness, but I ended up enjoying it quite a lot. The flavour was actually very similar to the bacon on a big American breakfast plate with pancakes, where some of the syrup has gotten onto the bacon so you get a sweet-savoury thing going on"

      caption: "Got some mango sticky rice for dessert. The mango was sweet, ripe and tasty."

      caption: "Paul got coconut ice cream which I took a bite of and was also very tasty. Loved the bits of peanut and crispy coconut in there."

Today I got a bunch of tasty food and sat on a plane for much longer than I wanted to.
