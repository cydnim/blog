      I went to a small stall on the corner of my street to grab some pork skewers and sticky rice for breakfast. I forgot to take a photo...

      I headed back to the hotel, checked out and went to the airport. I decided to get some fast food at the airport and went for KFC. They have this "zaab chicken" which felt like larb spices with fried chicken - very fresh, citrusy and spicy. Genuinely very tasty. Anyone wanna guess whether my flight got delayed? (it did)

      After checking in, I headed over to Patong beach to relax for a bit. It was already decently late so I didn't stick around long though.

      I walked over to a BBQ restaurant and had some nice grilled meat for dinner with some rice and prik nam pla!
