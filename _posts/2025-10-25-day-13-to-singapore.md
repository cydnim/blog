      Since it was my last day in Hong Kong I wanted to grab a last breakfast at one of these traditional cafes

      I headed back to my airbnb, finished packing up and headed over to the airport. The security/immigration process was so quick and efficient! A lot of facial recognition but they can have all my data if it makes the process that quick... After landing there was a bit of a hiccup with our luggage which led to me having to wait almost an hour for my bag, but it got their eventually. I grabbed a cab to the hotel and met up with Steven and Paul.

      We almost immediatedly headed out to Little India for dinner, to a Pakistani restaurant I remembered from my last time here. I really wanted the brain curry but unfortunately they were out of a lot of things for the day. The food was still really good though, and super cheap! We paid 22 SGD for food for 3 of us. I forgot to take photos of our food so you get our empty tray 😅
