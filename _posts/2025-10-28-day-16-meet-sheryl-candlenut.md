      Since I knew we'd be having a fancy meal for dinner today, I figured I'd just have a heavy brunch and skip lunch so I was nice and hungry for dinner. I headed to Maxwell Centre for some chicken rice, and then walked over to Hong Lim for some dessert.

      caption: This chicken rice was pretty good! The chili sauce was great, they were generous with the veggies, rice was good and the chicken was of course soft and silky. The reason the broth is dark is that it had a bunch of peanuts in it!

      caption: "This is an oyster cake. It had a crispy cakey outside with peanuts that gave it a nice textural balance. Inside, there was minced pork, shrimp, and an oyster."

      caption: "I walked over to Hong Lim Centre to grab a \"Granny Pancake\", which is a thick glutinous pancake with crispy edges around a stuffing of your choice. I chose peanut butter with crushed peanuts. Glorious."

      caption: "Egg tart! This was pretty different from the egg tarts I had in Hong Kong and Macau - the crust was much shorter, crumblier and \"melt in your mouth\" than the ultra crispy, flaky crusts I got there. The filling was also a lot softer and jigglier. Hard to say which one I liked more so... I won't! I am an equal opportunity egg tart enjoyer."

      I then headed West (everything so far had been in the central area of Singapore) to meet up with Sheryl, a close friend of mine from Boarding school. We basically just chatted and caught up before suddenly it was time for me to head out for my dinner reservation.

      For the "real" lunch, we walked over to Shrimp Prawn Seafood which is right on the river. This was my favourite meal last time I was in Singapore and remains a strong contender this visit too! Grilled shellfish over vermicelli served in a hot steel pan, with a super spicy chili sauce on the side. Good stuff. We also got some veggies and grilled pork skewers (moo ping).

      After lunch we walked over to the Gardens by the Bay. They have two huge conservatories there that are actually air conditioned in order to allow plants that need a cooler environment to survive in Singapore's heat. They use some specially treated glass to minimize heat passage while maximizing light for the plants in addition to some other strategies to make these large air conditioned domes more sustainable. We also went up to the top of one of the "supertree"s, which are large vertical gardens made to look like trees.

      After exploring the gardens, we headed over to the oceanarium. There were some really beautiful exhibits full of cool marine creatures including jellyfish, sharks, rays, and various types of fish small and large. They even had some pressurized tanks for deeper sea fish!

Today I went to a museum and ate a large amount of food.
