      Since I knew we'd be having a fancy meal for dinner today, I figured I'd just have a heavy brunch and skip lunch so I was nice and hungry for dinner. I headed to Maxwell Centre for some chicken rice, and then walked over to Hong Lim for some dessert.

      caption: This chicken rice was pretty good! The chili sauce was great, they were generous with the veggies, rice was good and the chicken was of course soft and silky. The reason the broth is dark is that it had a bunch of peanuts in it!

      caption: "This is an oyster cake. It had a crispy cakey outside with peanuts that gave it a nice textural balance. Inside, there was minced pork, shrimp, and an oyster."

      caption: "I walked over to Hong Lim Centre to grab a \"Granny Pancake\", which is a thick glutinous pancake with crispy edges around a stuffing of your choice. I chose peanut butter with crushed peanuts. Glorious."

      caption: "Egg tart! This was pretty different from the egg tarts I had in Hong Kong and Macau - the crust was much shorter, crumblier and \"melt in your mouth\" than the ultra crispy, flaky crusts I got there. The filling was also a lot softer and jigglier. Hard to say which one I liked more so... I won't! I am an equal opportunity egg tart enjoyer."

      I then headed West (everything so far had been in the central area of Singapore) to meet up with Sheryl, a close friend of mine from Boarding school. We basically just chatted and caught up before suddenly it was time for me to head out for my dinner reservation.

      The best way to get to dinner happened to be getting off at the Singapore Botanic Gardens stop and walking through the garden. Unfortunately I was rushing a bit since I was worried about being late to my reservation so didn't have time to stop and enjoy the beautiful garden, but I did take a couple photos. I would have liked to go to the orchid gardens - part of Singapore's diplomatic strategy is that they breed custom orchids for various world leaders so they have a bunch of interesting and unique orchids here.

      Slightly sweaty from my speedwalk through the garden, I made it to Candlenut in time to meet Steven and Paul for our reservation. This was a fantastic meal, and certainly lived up to its michelin star. Candlenut focuses on Peranakan cuisine. Peranakan is a word used to refer to the descendants of early Chinese migrants to South East Asia, and the cuisine combines Chinese, Malay, Javanese and South Indian influences for some delicious food. Make sure to click into each photo for a description of the dish and what I thought of it!

      caption: "Kueh Pie Tee with braised turnip, dried cuttlefish, pork belly and shiitake. Loved the crunch and the little bits of cuttlefish. Sauce wasn't as spicy as the one I had on the food tour which helped the other ingredients shine a bit more."
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-2.jpg
      caption: "Ngoh Hiang (pork and shrimp roll wrapped in beancurd skin). This had a sweet sauce on the side and it was hitting those sweet savoury flavour notes, really good."
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-3.jpg
      caption: "Crispy Prawn Fritters with Sambal Tomat. Nice hit of heat before mellowing out and becoming more prawn-forward"
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-4.jpg
      caption: "Charcoal Grilled Satay Pork with Buah Keluak sauce. Buah Keluak is a black nut that requires 40ish days of preparation to remove its toxicity, otherwise it can be poisonous. It was a really interesting flavour, and the pork was fatty and melt-in-your-mouth unctuous"
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-5.jpg
      caption: "Yong Tau Foo Soup. This had several bits and bobs including a stuffed tofu puff, stuffed shiitake and fish cake in a rich chicken broth. It was a really light flavour with a bit of a citrusy note. Interestingly, it kinda felt like it could be Mexican in a way. Paul likened it to a tortilla soup."
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-6.jpg
      caption: "Wing Bean Salad with Calamansi dressing. Loved the strong citrus flavour. The shrimp was sweet and the crispy anchovy gave it a crunch and umami saltiness."
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-7.jpg
      caption: "Ikan Woku: Steamed barramundi in a spicy tomato sauce. This was sweet and spicy with tender fish and the cherry tomatoes gave it a nice burst of flavour."
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-8.jpg
      caption: "Semur Beef: Beef braised in sweet soy with potato and carrot. This was sweet and cinnamon-forward with a very deep flavour."
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-9.jpg
      caption: "Prawn Masak Lemak: Prawn and spiny gourd in a spicy turmeric-rich coconut-based curry. Very spicy, candidate for my favourite dish of the night. The spiny gourd had a very interesting texture, almost like a seafood shell."
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-10.jpg
      caption: "Telur Masak Rempah Kering: Sunny side up egg with a lime leaf-infused minced pork curry. Super smooth with the yolk and I really enjoyed the thick, spicy ground pork curry on top."
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-11.jpg
      caption: "Candlenut Blue Swimmer Crab Curry: Crab in a coconutty curry infused with lime leaf and galangal. This is the other candidate for favourite dish of the night. Interestingly, despite sharing several ingredients with the prawn curry this was very different. The lime leaf flavour was front and center and made a nice complement to the soft sweetness of the crab."
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-12.jpg
      caption: "Bubur Pulat Hitam: Black rice sorbet over coconut shaved ice with taro and sweet potato balls. The coconut shaved ice was next level and the little taro/sweet potato balls were great. Wasn't crazy about the black rice though."
    - src: /assets/images/day16/cn-13.jpg
      caption: "Left: Cassava Kueh (Bruleed caramel custard over cassava cake), Right: Apam Pisang Kukus (Steamed banana cake with banana compote). The Cassava Kueh was my favourite dessert, essentially a creme brulee on top of a bouncy cake. The banana cake was also delicious though, it was so soft with a strong banana flavour and a bit of a texture difference with the compote."
