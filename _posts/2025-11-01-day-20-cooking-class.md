      Paul and I wondered through an alleyway to find a pho place that had come highly recommended and was only open for breakfast. Unfortunately they had already run out by the time we arrived at 9:20 (they close at 10), so we instead headed to a different pho spot that also looked really good (spoiler: it was really good).

      Since I knew we were probably gonna have a lot of food at the cooking class, I decided to keep it somewhat light for lunch and just get a banh bao - a bun containing ground pork, duck egg yolk and a quail egg.

      I was really excited for this and it still managed to exceed my expectations! Our guide Alex picked us up at our hotel and took us to HCMC's Chinatown in District 5. We explored Binh Tay Market a bit before buying some ingredients - Alex "forced" us to learn some Vietnamese by writing down how to order and having us read it out to the vendors. After the market, we walked over to Auntie Four's (yes, Four - I thought I may have misheard but I double-checked with Alex!) house to get started cooking! She lives in a house with 4 generations of her family (her mom, her daughter and son-in-law, and their kids) and cooks professionally, cooking in her home kitchen to sell to members of the neighbourhood who come buy it to take home. She guided us through the dishes with Alex serving as a translator. While she didn't fully trust us to do things completely ourselves (anything involving portioning and spices was handled by her), we were in charge of all the manual labour of chopping and stirring! After we were done, Alex joined us to eat at a table outside the house. This was one of the best things I did in Vietnam and stuff you make (or at least, help make) yourself tends to taste better but I think I still have to say that this was my favourite meal in Vietnam so far!
