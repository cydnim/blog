    text: |
      In the morning we took the metro to the ferry terminal and bought tickets to Macau. It was an hour long trip and fairly organized. Thankfully Steven had met some people who had told him to make sure he brings his passport - otherwise both him and I would've assumed it was like visiting Italy from France where you don't really need a passport unless you're going through an airport.

      We then stopped at Lou Lim Ioc garden, which was right next to the coffee shop and was very beautiful

      We walked over to the Ruins of the Church of St. Paul, which is all that's left of a church that was destroyed in a fire in 1835.

      We then headed over to Taipa Island to try a pineapple bun pork chop sandwich, and also got a Portuguese-style egg tart at Rua do Cunha nearby

      We headed to one of the casinos on Taipa Island. While I'm not much of a gambler, Steven wanted to try his hand at some poker and I came with him to check out the casino.

    text: |
      After checking out the casino and saying bye to Steven, I headed back into central Taipa to wander around and try some more food. to try some beef offal stew, which is a traditional Macau dish that has a strong Portuguese influence from colonial times

      After walking around Macau for another hour or-so, we headed back to the ferry terminal to catch the next ferry into HK
  - title: "Chicken Dinner"
    text: |
      After arriving back in HK, we wandered around the central area for 45ish minutes before heading to our dinner reservation at Louise. This French restaurant has a michelin star! We didn't eat in the starred section though, instead opting to sit in the more casual (and cheaper!) La Terrace area. I have to imagine the food is fairly similar though, cause it was delicious. After this we were plenty tired from our long day and headed back to the airbnb for bed.
