    text: |
      Cha chaan tengs are HK-style diners and are everywhere here. Steven and I headed over to one to grab breakfast

  - title: "Chungking Mansions"

      After breakfast, we walked over to Chungking Mansions which is a curious area that Steven wanted to check out. It's got lots of immigrants - plenty of really good looking Indian food, electrical stores and foreign exchange stores.

      We headed back to our airbnb for a bit of a rest (where I stopped to write the day 8 and 9 posts) before Steven had to head out for the airport since he's heading to Singapore a few days earlier than me.
  - title: "Star Ferry"
    text: |
      I headed over to the pier to take the star ferry over to Hong Kong Island (I'm staying in Tsim Sha Tsui, which is on the mainland-side of HK). You _can_ just take the metro over (which is what we did to get to the Macau ferry terminal yesterday), but this is cooler!

  - title: "Roast Goose Lunch"

      I ate lunch at a roast goose place that has been recommended by the Michelin Guide since 2015

  - title: "Riding the tram"
    text: |
      After lunch, I hopped on the tram and just rode it to the end of the line, waited till it turned around and rode it further back in the opposite direction, far past the stop I had initially gotten on at. I was at the front of the car and it was a great way to get a view of various parts of the city

      After riding the tram for a while, I decided to head to a bakery for an egg tart

    text: |
      I headed back to the airbnb for a bit of a rest, and then headed back out to get noodles at a place Steven had recommended to me

      caption: "The noodles were dressed in a sauce made out of roast goose fat (they're big on roast goose here if you hadn't noticed). They were very tasty, but also super heavy. Definitely not something you could eat everyday."
