  - title: Morning Canal Ride
    text: |
      I started off the day with a boat ride around the canals of Bangkok. I woke up early to make it to our meeting point at 6am, and walked through town with my guide Susie, learning a bit about the history of the area as we walked towards the canals. We bought some rice and stir fry to offer as alms to a monk and then hopped on a boat. We rode around for a while, saw several temples and beautiful houses and finished up at a peaceful coffee shop on the side of the river.

  - title: Crab Omelette Breakfast
    text: |
      I headed to Jay Fai for breakfast, a legendary spot where all the food is cooked by one aunty at a wok - she doesn’t let anyone else handle the cooking. As a result, the service is slow and the prices are exorbitant compared to what you’d normally pay in Bangkok (and it’s cash only so I had to make a stop at the ATM to pull out enough cash to pay…), but the omelette was great. Bursting full of crab to the point that there was much more crab than egg in this omelette, and the omelette outside was super crispy from being wok fried.

  - title: Coffee Break
    text: |
      After this, I headed to a coffee shop for a while to chill out. This coffee shop was filled with colourful paintings that I found out were painted by the barista, and the guy who owned the place was super friendly and welcoming. He even noticed that I was clearing my throat a bunch and brought me some complementary hot tea to soothe it.

      I happened to be very close by to a famous pad thai spot, so figured I’d walk over for lunch and get their egg wrapped pad thai.

  - title: Cooking Class 2
    text: |
      I was very excited for this class and it lived up to expectations! I had specifically asked for something spicy, and not the usual pad thai/green curry that literally every other cooking class seemed to offer and my teacher Jib delivered! She welcomed me into her family kitchen and helped me cook three dishes which were mostly new to me: yum tua plu (spicy wing bean “salad”), tod mun moo (spiced pork fritters) and pad cha (spicy stir fried meat). The idea behind pad cha is you come home drunk and throw whatever you have in the fridge into a wok and fry it up. If you add noodles to it you get pad kee mao, aka drunken noodles!

  - title: Ghost Stories and Spirituality
    text: |
      After dinner, I headed over to meet my guide Esso and fellow tour attendee James to learn a bit about Thai spirituality and how they treat the dead. It was very interesting to learn about the customs they have for treating the bodies and we even got to talk to the head mortician of a large temple about some of the traditions. We also visited a shrine to a local ghost named Mae Nak, who is associated with luck and prosperity (despite her not seeming to have had much of that during life…). I also got several recommendations for Kuala Lumpur and Manila from James, so thank you for that!

Today I was busy! Went down a canal, learned some cooking and learned about Thai spirituality.
