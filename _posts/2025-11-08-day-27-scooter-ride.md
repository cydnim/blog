  - title: Pad Kra Pao Breakfast
    text: |
      I started off the day with some pad kra pao for breakfast. As long as there's an egg on there it counts as breakfast, right?

  - title: Do I like massages now?
    text: |
      Those who know me well know I generally don't like massages since I don't like people touching me. That said, considering I was in Thailand I figured I may as well try it, just to double check. To answer the question: kinda? I enjoyed the foot massage part, and the shoulders, but the rest of it was just ticklish and not super enjoyable.
  - title: Pad Kra Pao Lunch?

      Don't judge, I really like pad kra pao. Also this one was different - it was with sour fermented pork sausage instead of ground pork! It was spicier too.

  - title: Scooter Ride around Bangkok
    text: |
      Around 6:30, I headed to the meeting point for my scooter ride, where my guide Phillip had prepared some escooters for us. I was with a group of older German tourists who were visiting Thailand for the first time! It was a fun group, and it was super cool to see all the Thai landmarks lit up at night.
