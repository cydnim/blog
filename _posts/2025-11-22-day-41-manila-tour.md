  - title: Touring Manila City
    text: |
      The Manila area is actually made up of several smaller cities, and today I toured around the original Manila city by rickshaw (actually they call them escooters here because they're electric!). It was pretty interesting, and I definitely got to see a lot of areas I would not have otherwise explored and rode in a jeepney!

  - title: Lechon Lunch

      After the tour, I headed to a restaurant nearby to get some lechon kawali, which is a Filipino classic of crispy deep fried pork belly. It was super tasty and very decadent.

      caption: The crispy, juicy pork belly and the sour, slightly spicy sauce went perfectly together. I don't think I've ever had pork belly this crispy before.

      caption: Flan for dessert! Super smooth and tasty.
  - title: Grilled Skewer Dinner
    text: |
      After a fairly late and extremely rich lunch, I decided to keep dinner somewhat light with just a few skewers. These were very tasty, and it was cool to pick out the skewers I wanted and have them freshly grilled in front of me.
