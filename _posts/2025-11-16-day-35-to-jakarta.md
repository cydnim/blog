  - title: Nasi Lemak Breakfast
    text: |
      I have really had a lot of nasi lemak and I’m not stopping now! I wanted to check out a new spot, but due to needing to pack/check out/etc I didn’t have time to actually go to a restaurant, so I ordered delivery. I got sambal cockles and didn’t take a photo bc it wasn’t super attractive looking once it reached me 😅

      There’s an express train from KL Sentral station directly to KUL airport, which is nice by itself. The extra cool part though, is that if you’re flying Malaysia Airlines (which I was) you can check in directly at the train station, which not only saves you the time of standing in line at the airport, but also means you don’t need to worry about carrying your check-in luggage onto the train! Super convenient.

      After arriving with some time to spare and chilling at the airport, I boarded my flight to Jakarta. Any guesses on whether it was delayed or not? It actually arrived 20 min early! Way to beat expectations.

  - title: Nasi Padang
    text: |
      After checking into my hotel, I got an early dinner of nasi padang! I love this - they basically bring a shit ton of plates of food to your table and you pick what looks good to you. At the end of your meal you get charged for only the plates you ate. I just love having so many options literally within arm’s reach.

      caption: Look at all the options! They brought a few more dishes out after I took this photo so only one of the dishes I ate (beef rendang) is not actually in this image. Apart from that, I ate the fried beef jerky in the top right and the sautéed papaya leaves slightly left of middle.
