      With some Japanese cash burning a hole in my pocket that I needed to spend before leaving, I knew exactly where to go. Sushi is not typically a breakfast food, but there were plenty of spots open early in the morning at the market when I was there for the tour so I headed there to grab one last bit of sushi.

      I was again reminded how nice it would be if trains existed in the US (I expect this will be a continuous theme as a lot of the places I'm visiting have good transit). I was able to catch an airport express from a station 10 min away from my hotel which took me straight to the airport!

      I was hit by some really bad delays. First, my flight to Taipei was delayed by half an hour. No worries I thought, I should still have plenty of time! As the flight got closer to Taipei however I realized that we were staying in the air for quite a while for some reason. This reason became clearer as we started descending and going through some crazy turbulence. I was extremely worried I would miss my connection, but thankfully there was someone waiting outside the arrival gate with a sign for my flight to Hong Kong. After a long walk to the gate, we discovered that the flight hadn't even started boarding yet despite being scheduled to leave 5 minutes ago! The incoming flight had been similarly delayed due to the rough landing conditions. I texted Steven (who was already in Hong Kong) and learned that there was apparently a typhoon expected in Hong Kong, which is probably the same storm that was causing issues in Taipei. The landing in Hong Kong was similarly rough, and these two flights probably had the roughest landings I've ever personally experienced, so shout out the pilots for navigating us through them! I was very tired upon arriving in HK so took an uber straight to our airbnb and went to bed.

Today I had some last bits of Japanese food and encountered several delays on my way to Hong Kong
