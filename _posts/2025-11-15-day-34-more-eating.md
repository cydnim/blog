  - title: Food Tour 2
    text: |
      Just a short walk from my hotel was a beef noodle spot that I had seen with a long line a couple days ago. I decided to head over right as it opened in the hope of avoiding a line but was a bit late and the restaurant was already packed with a line of 6-7 people. The food took quite a while in coming, I’m guessing because they had just filled up the restaurant with people who had lined up before opening and hadn’t been able to catch up to new seatings yet. Once I did get my food, I started to understand why people were willing to wait in line so long for this stuff. I got the mixed soup bowl which came with 4 cuts: meatballs, sliced brisket, ground beef and tripe. I restrained myself and added just enough of the house chilli sauce to give it a slight kick without overpowering any of the other flavours of the rich beef broth, and quickly demolished a delicious bowl of beef noodle soup.

      I had ruined a pair of shorts a couple days ago by staining them with food and was also carrying a pair I didn’t really like much so decided I’d go buy some new clothes and get rid of those shorts. Got 2 new pairs of shorts and a tshirt too.
  - title: More Nasi Lemak

      I decided at this point that I should just commit to trying a bunch of nasi lemak and so went to Village Park, another famous spot. This was probably the best overall plate but the rice at Wanjo during the food tour was still better imo.

      caption: I got fried chicken and sambal squid (on the side). The chicken was crispy and juicy, and I enjoyed the crispy bits on top despite not being completely sure what they were (fried off bits of spice paste maybe?). The squid retained its bite without being chewy or rubbery at all and the sambal it was cooked in gave it a delicious spicy taste.

  - title: Botanical Gardens = Skipped

      I had planned on heading to the KL botanical gardens and checking out their bird and butterfly parks, but I guess after all the travel and walking it was catching up with me a bit and my feet were hurting a lot so I decided to just rest up in my hotel for a bit.
  - title: Claypot Rice Dinner
    text: |
      For dinner, I braved the heavy rain (jk I took a taxi) to a claypot rice spot. There was a lineup of clay pots sitting over coal and the uncle there was preparing each one, perfectly cooking the rice and timing when each new ingredient needed to be added. Impressive skill. The rice had chicken and lap cheong in it and had crisped up nicely at the bottom of the clay pot. It was a lot of food but I finished it easily due to how tasty it was!

      I took a short walk after getting back from clay pot and these birds were super loud. There were so many of them all over the trees. The video doesn't really do justice to how loud these guys were.
