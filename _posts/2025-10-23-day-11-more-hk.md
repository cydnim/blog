      I started the day with a walk around Kowloon Park. It was filled with birdsong and very peaceful.

      I started the day with a tour around some of Hong Kong's older neighbourhoods, learning about the housing crisis in Hong Kong and the effects of wealth inequality

      After the tour, I headed to Bo Innovation for lunch to try their set tasting menu with several interesting, innovative dishes.

      While looking up places to eat dinner, one of the recommendations online was a place called Peking Garden which specialized in Peking Duck. I hadn't had this nostalgic dish in quite a while so it felt like the perfect option
