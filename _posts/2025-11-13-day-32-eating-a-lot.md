  - title: Nasi Lemak Breakfast
    text: |
      Nasi lemak again? Well... it _is_ traditionally eaten as breakfast. Also nasi lemak and similar foods are my favourites - you get to have so many different tastes and textures in one plate! Very difficult to manage otherwise when traveling solo. They had a whole selection of various options you could add to your nasi lemak base, and I got sambal squid and chilli beef lung. It even came with kang kung (morning glory) so I got a bit of veg in too. Very tasty.

      caption: Definitely better than yesterday's nasi lemak. The sambal was more flavourful, the options were more interesting and I liked that I could get multiple options if I wanted.

  - title: Temple Visit

      Decided to visit the Sin Sze Si Ya temple, the oldest Taoist temple in KL.

      caption: The interior. It was fairly smoky due to all the incense being burned.
  - title: Ikan Bakar Lunch
    text: |
      I made my way to my next food spot, which serves ikan bakar or grilled fish. This place wrapped the fish in a banana leaf with a spice paste and cooked it on a hot griddle. It's then served up with a spicy dipping sauce, rice, and veggies. I asked which fish had the fewest bones since I don't like dealing with bones and was recommended pari aka stingray! That was something I'd never tried before so double bonus - fewer bones and something new!

      caption: The unwrapped stingray. It actually had barely any bone apart from the cartillage-y bone running down the middle. It was super sticky and meaty, and went great with the citrusy spicy dipping sauce. Highly recommend to anyone visiting KL.

  - title: Coffee Break
    text: |
      I went back to my hotel, grabbed my laptop and headed back out to a coffee shop where I sat outside and worked on these blogs (except the ones from several days ago since I am fairly behind at this point) for a couple hours

      caption: Got a flat white and a really tasty lemon cake which had a really nice tang to it.
  - title: Food Tour!
    text: |
      Once my laptop ran out of battery, I headed back to my hotel and relaxed a bit before my 5:30pm food tour! Spoiler: this is not the only food tour I'm doing in KL. My guide was great, and I got to try so many tasty and interesting dishes!

      caption: Mini pineapples. These were not actually Malay, instead they were from Thailand. We got them anyway because my guide was a huge fan of these. They're super sweet without any acidity, though to be honest I kinda like the acidity you normally get with pineapple.

      caption: I've forgotten what these noodles were tbh, but they were tasty and came with chicken and a calamansi half to squeeze over the top.

      caption: "Roti with three curries. From left to right: chicken curry, sambar and fish curry. The roti was super crispy and flaky and the fish curry was my favourite as it had a touch of sourness from tamarind and was really well balanced."
    - src: /assets/images/day32/ft-4.jpg
      caption: Malaysian chicken burger. These were _extremely_ saucy with ketchup, mayo and chilli sauce on them. Very tasty, though I'm not used to my burgers being so wet.

      caption: Cendol, which is shaved ice topped with coconut milk, palm sugar syrup, pandan "noodles" made of rice flour and sweet corn. This was super tasty, and the palm sugar syrup reminded me of shakkar with the caramelized flavour.

      caption: We got 2 - a pandan flavour and a plain one. Both had a dollop of palm sugar in the center, which you can't see in this photo because it's being covered by the shaved coconut. Slightly dry but still tasty!

      caption: I thought this was a super smart usage of the mini fans I see everyone carrying around to deal with the head - use them to help manage the charcoal!
    - src: /assets/images/day32/ft-9.jpg
      caption: Mihun soup on the left, which was rice vermicelli in a beef soup with meatballs. It was very beefy and tasty. I forget the name of the one on the right, but it was chicken in a curry sauce with some veggies and (I think) fried wonton wrappers. Also very tasty and spicy!
    - src: /assets/images/day32/ft-10.jpg
      caption: The result of that mini fan charcoal technique - more ikan bakar, this time without the banana leaf and directly on charcoal instead of a griddle. This was super tasty, and I really enjoyed trying it with each sauce to see how they were different. I think my favourite was the sweet soy with chilli on the right.

      caption: Malaysian satay, which is marinated for at least 6 hours and contains a bit of fat between the pieces of meat to keep everything juicy. This was super tasty, and those bits of fat had crisped up nicely over the grill.

      caption: More nasi lemak! My third in 1.5 days 😅. This one probably had the best rice so far, and the chicken curry was spiced really nicely too.
    - src: /assets/images/day32/ft-13.jpg
      caption: Nasi kerabu, which is rice coloured with butterfly pea and served with crackers, veggies and herbs. A nice refreshing end to a food tour filled with heavy foods!
  - title: Saloma Link

      Before heading back, I crossed over the Saloma Link towards the Petronas Twin Towers and got some nice shots of the skyline at night.

      caption: Once I got back to my metro stop, I got to see Masjid Jamek lit up at night too! They were spraying some water in front of it which created a really pretty mist that was lit up with these blue lights.
