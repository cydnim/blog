      Another flight that landed early! This was super helpful since it meant I could get to my hotel and fall asleep earlier too.

      I didn't sleep super long though unfortunately. The upside of this was that the hotel breakfast was still running, and I got some tasty Filipino breakfast with a few different meats with rice, topped with 2 runny eggs.

      My first activity for Manila was a cooking class. We made lumpia (veggie spring rolls), turon (deep fried banana wraps) and pancit bihon (stir fried vermicelli).

      caption: The wrapped turon, which used the same type of wrap as the lumpia. I had 2 nutella ones, a jackfruit jam one and a brown sugar one (which is the classic).

      caption: After we fried the turon, our instructor told us to chuch a few spoons of brown sugar in the hot oil, mix it around a bit till it turns to caramel, and then throw the turon back in there to coat... Very decadent, but very tasty.

  - title: Tired Dinner
    text: |
      After the cooking class, I went and rested at my hotel for a while and decided I was too tired to go far. As a result, I ate dinner at one of the hotel restaurants (and didn't feel bad about it considering it was on the michelin guide!)

      caption: Kinilaw - Essentially a Filipino ceviche. This was really good with a strong acidic kick, and I really enjoyed the strips of raw mango and ginger in it.

      caption: Bistek Tagalog - A steak stew with soy sauce, vinegar and calamansi. This was rich, slightly sweet, and I really appreciated the acid of the vinegar and calamansi cutting through all the richness.

Today I arrived in Manila and tired myself out quickly.
