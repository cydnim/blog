      Yep, 2 food tours here as well! This time we’re exploring the Chinatown area of KL. Lots of interesting and tasty food!

      caption: Forgot exactly what this was called, but it was a sweet made of pounded peanuts

      caption: Clam noodle soup. This was sooo good. Strong ginger flavour, the light sweetness and saltiness of the clams and a slight alcoholic flavour from the shaoxing wine made this super tasty. Genuinely much tastier than I was expecting it to be.

      caption: An egg tart, this was similar to the one I had in Singapore with a short, crumbly pastry.

      caption: Pork siew pow, a flaky pork hand pie. Very flavourful, but similar to the one in Phuket the pastry was a bit too thick for my taste. I guess that comes from an initial goal of making these easy to carry around?

      caption: Chee cheung fun - hand chopped rice noodles with an addictive sweet/spicy sauce topped with sesame seeds and pickled chilli slices.

      caption: Tau fu fah - soft tofu pudding with palm sugar syrup. This was super tasty, the soft tofu was freshly made and served hot. Very custardy texture and the palm sugar syrup made it very tasty.

      caption: He’s smooth with it

      caption: Mochi in crushed peanuts. You can’t really tell because of the sheer amount of crushed peanuts, but there were several different colours and flavours of mochi including pandan, lychee and even ribena! I think the lychee one was my favourite.

      caption: Curry laksa. This was sooo good. I added a bit of the sambal to my portion and was rewarded with a delicious, complex, spicy, coconutty noodle soup. I admittedly only had one bowl of laksa in Singapore so not really a fair comparison, but this bowl was better than that bowl 😅

      caption: More chicken rice! Fairly similar to the one I had a couple days ago and very tasty.
  - title: Kampung Baru Tour
    text: |
      After resting for a while to recover from all my eating in the morning I took the train over to Kampung Baru. This area was established in 1900 during the colonial era to protect some land for the local Malay people and is still reserved for the descendants of those people. With the boom of KL as a metropolitan city, it has evolved from farmland to a sprawling set of closely packed houses as people moved in to live on their family’s property in the big city. I met up with my guide Fuad and the other tour attendees and we got a nice view into life in the area and how it has changed over the last few decades.

      caption: I forget what these were called but they were little rice flour cakes shaped like idlis with palm sugar in them. Similar to the one I had yesterday, fairly dry but tasty with the palm sugar.

      caption: The inside of Fuad’s family home, where we relaxed for a bit and were served some snacks.

      caption: The snacks - fried banana and kaya jam cakes

      caption: After walking around for a while we stopped for dinner and got some satay! It was being cooked outside over this nice charcoal grill.

      caption: This was even better than the satay from yesterday! Soft, juicy, well marinated meat with bits of crispy char and peanut sauce on the side. Beautiful.
