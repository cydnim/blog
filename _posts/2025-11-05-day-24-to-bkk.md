      I just chilled at the hotel this morning and did nothing until it was time to check out and head to my flight. It was nice.

      My flight got delayed again lol. What's new? After I got to Bangkok, I caught a cab to my hotel and got caught in so much traffic that it was already nearly time for me to head out for my dinner reservation by the time I got there.

      My first meal in Bangkok was a banger. Le Du is a michelin starred restaurant with a seasonal menu that gives you an interesting take on Thai food.

      caption: Mushroom and pate with "stinky foam". This was 2 pieces of grilled mushroom and a piece of pate covered with a durian based foam. Slightly sweet, mushroomy savoury, yum.

      caption: This fish tartare was really tasty with a touch of spice and a strong galangal and lime taste.

      caption: Tart with chicken pate and spherified maeng da (water bug) "essence". The essence is the pheromones extracted from these bugs, and is spicy and traditionally used in nam prik sauces. The pate was smooth and creamy, the bits of pickled radish and onion on top provided a nice contrast of texture and freshness, and the maeng da spheres provided some nice spicy pops.

      caption: Crab salad seved on a custard made with crab liver and shrimp. Love the sweetness that always comes with crab meat, the acidity and spiciness of the dressing goes great with the rich, fishy custard and the cucumber and pickled onion provide nice hits of acidic freshness. Yes I took this photo after I had eaten half of it already. Oops.

      caption: Seasonal fish over beetroot and carrot noodles with a Northeastern heb sorbet. The fact that there was a sorbet on here initially threw me off a bit but damn was it tasty. The fish is meaty and has a relatively strong flavour, the sorbet is herby and spicy, great combination. The noodles weren't really doing much flavour-wise and could probably have been replaced with just regular rice noodles but the colour is interesting.

      caption: Goby dish with bitter beef foam over over clam and fish bone broth with a catfish clam "taco" (the shell was catfish deep fried). The broth had some sort of flower in it, the galangal flavour was very present and the spice was not hiding. I was instructed to take one bit of fish + broth and one bit of taco so I got the flavours interlaced, but tbh I can't say I noticed anything specific with the combination (they were individually both very tasty though).

      caption: Pickled zucchini over pea eggplants, mushrooms, edamame and something I don't remember but tasted like broccoli (it wasn't broccoli though) with a vegetable broth. The broth definitely surprised me and was really the star of the show here. It was super rich and savoury, and had a strong char flavour from the roasted edamame with a slight bit of acidity and sweetness.

      caption: Chargrilled dry aged duck with duck larb in some sort of leaf (I forgot...), beef tendon topped with fried ginger and chilli and a smoked beef curry sauce with Northeastern spices. The duck was chewier than I expected but had a great flavour. The larb was tasty and its acidic freshness did a great job of cutting through what was otherwise an extremely rich dish. The tendon was divine and the highlight of the dish for me. It was like the platonic ideal of what tendon should be. Soft, chewy, sticky, gelatinous and melt-in-your mouth all at the same time with a strong beefy flavour. I will be thinking about it every time I have tendon in the future.

      caption: Sticky rice cooked in sweet wine, seasonal fruits, sweet corn mousse and pork floss ice cream topped with pickled ginger. Fairly light flavours, I couldn't really taste the pork floss in the ice cream but maybe that's a good thing? Everything tasted super fresh and the sticky rice was very soft.

      caption: Coconut panna cotta topped with bits of coconut, a sweet cream and algae ice cream covered with a plum jelly and little brown sugar crystals. This was really good. Extremely sweet, but not in a bad way because of how fresh everything also tastes. The bits of brown sugar on top give it a great bit of texture and all the flavours meld really well together.

      caption: Pandan and coconut jelly. What can I say? It was tasty jelly!

      caption: Fruit salad. Again, what can I say? Tasty pieces of fresh fruit!
