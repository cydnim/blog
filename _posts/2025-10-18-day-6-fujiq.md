      Right after getting into the park I headed straight to Fujiyama. When it was opened, it held records for the tallest rollercoaster and highest drop! It started off with a slow climb up and up until the aforementioned (formerly) highest drop, sweeping into a large arc and following it up with several “bunny” hills. It didn’t have any loops, but that put the focus on the speed at which you’re going. This was also the longest ride I went on at ~4 minutes.

      This one is definitely a contender for my favourite ride at the park. I went on this one twice! They call this one a “4D” coaster since not only is the ride going around the track at strange angles, but your seat itself is also rotating throughout the ride which indeed does add another dimension to the experience. It was the only one I had to take my shoes off for! All the other rides had lockers where you needed to empty your pockets and leave any loose items, but this was the only one without shoes allowed due to how much you get flung around (there was no floor on the cars - your legs are just hanging off). There were points where I went from looking at the ground to looking at the sky from one moment to the next. This ride features the most inversions in the world, with several loops in addition to your seat spinning around! Before the ride there were several safety warnings and a briefing on how important it was to maintain your posture for safety, leading to some nervousness before the ride but by the end I was so giddy that I wanted nothing more than to go again.

      This is the other contender for my favourite ride at the park, and another one I rode twice (and I was lucky enough to be at the front both times)! It doesn’t have the highest drop, but it does have a drop angle of 121° (ie more than vertical), making it one of the steepest coasters in the world. It starts off with a quick launch through a dark tunnel followed by a few turns and a sudden deceleration as your reach a completely vertical climb. The climb seems to last forever, and they build the anticipation by stopping the car right before you reach the top. As you come around the top, the anticipation continues building as you move slowly forward and down until the angle is such that you’re leaning forward below the edge, as if you’re going to fall out of your seat. And then they drop you, and you’re tossed around as the speed builds and you go through several twists, turns and loops in no time at all. Super exhilarating.

      A much tamer ride, but still a lot of fun. This was a “motorbike-style” ride where you sit on a seat that is engineered to feel like a motorcycle and looks like something out of Tron. You’re leaning forwards and grabbing the handles during the ride. I imagine this is somewhat like how a MotoGP driver feels, without any of the skill required or the risks (and with more sudden twists and turns than is reasonable for an actual rider to do). I was in the second row to start with, but I got lucky since the older couple who were in the first row decided that might be a bit too much for them and asked if I’d switch with them. Who am I to say no to an upgrade? There were several launches where your cars sped up suddenly, and a backwards section too. I was encouraged to lean into the turns and curves in order to get the full experience, and that certainly added to it. Less terrifying than the other rides since it’s lacks the height and speed, but still a really fun experience!

      Unlike typical amusement parks I've been too in the US, the food selection here was actually pretty good and not super overpriced!

      This was less of a ride and more of an immersive simulation. It felt very reminiscent of the 4D ride that I used to love going to at The Science Museum in London as a child, but on steroids. The technology at work made it very impressive and fun. For those who don’t know Attack on Titan, it’s an anime show where the characters move around with special gear that allows them to essentially swing around buildings and trees like spiderman with his webs. After getting situated, your seats are moved forward to hang in the air in front of a huge, curved wall covered with screens. Through clever movement of the chairs (both the chairs themselves and the angles), the scene on the screen, wind machines, and mist sprays, you really are made to feel like you’re swinging around the buildings and titans as one of the scenes from the anime plays out around you.

As much as I like the mountains, this was not actually a relaxing day in the mountains. In reality, I headed to FujiQ highlands, an amusement park close to Mt Fuji with a beautiful view and some intense rides! I took a relaxing bus ride to the park and parts of the route reminded me of the drive up to Darmani with the windy roads through green-covered mountains. It was honestly quite funny to see the park with its huge and intricate rides suddenly pop up on the horizon in the middle of all these hills. While I thought I’d try to enjoy the view of the mountain from the rides, turns out moving super quickly and being flung about 🫨 does not lend itself well to enjoying views… That being said, I loved my time at the park and these rides had me smiling and giggling like an idiot😅
