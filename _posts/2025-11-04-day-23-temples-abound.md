      Grabbed some breakfast at the hotel, one of the things they had were these minced pork skewers with sticky rice and spicy jaew bong.

  - title: Wat Si Saket
    text: |
      Vientiane has a lot of temples. Pretty much every two blocks you see a temple. I took a walk to Wat Si Saket, which is one of the oldest temples still standing in Vientiane. They had a _lot_ of buddhas there. I wasn’t allowed to take photos inside the main temple, but its walls were decorated in paintings depicting the life of buddha.

      At this point I decided I had walked around enough that I could go treat myself to some lunch.

      I saw an interesting looking French restaurant nearby and decided to check it out. Didn't fill up here though bc I wanted to stop at a street stall on the way back.

      caption: Some beef carpaccio! It was really tender and tasty, and I guess they had to adapt to the Lao palate since it not only came with bread, but also some sliced red chilli on the side!
