  text: 'We can laugh now but this morning I fainted when getting up to pee. Luckily
    Sahir caught and held me. Went to ER and 6 hours later left cleared after fluids
    and ruling out DVT/cardiac etc. The POTS flare saga continues. They also found
    very mild hyponatremia and elevated AST/ALT likely due to the injections and trying
    to restart my antidepressant.
